<h3>FIRST ARTICLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Illness</span> in some form is so often amongst us,
that it may safely be said there is no occupation
of more universal importance than the care of
the sick, and there are few women worthy of the
name who at some time or other are not called
upon to minister to the needs of sufferers by
disease or accident.</p>

<p>Much has been done of late years to improve
the tone of nursing amongst those who take
it up as a profession, so that the ‘Sarey Gamp’
of old times has practically given place to the
skilled, conscientious nurse, who has been trained
to look upon her work as something more than
a mere means of livelihood. But whilst
this is true of those who devote their lives
to nursing, there still remains a vast amount of
ignorance, even of its very elements, amongst
those who are only occasionally called upon to
bedside-ministration, and it is our object in this
series of papers to give our readers such information
as may fit them to act on an emergency, if
not with the skill of the trained nurse, with at
least so much knowledge and intelligence as shall
give the patient some chance of comfort and help.
Not, of course, that the practical work of nursing
can be acquired by any amount of book-knowledge
alone; but for those who cannot spare time for
regular hospital training, it is of great importance
to understand at anyrate what should be aimed
at in nursing; and were this more widely understood,
it would do much towards mitigating the
avoidable sufferings inflicted on unhappy patients
who have to be nursed by those who are full
of love indeed, but without any idea of the
work they are undertaking.</p>

<p>This brings me to a point on which I can
hardly be too emphatic. In cases of serious illness,
especially where there is much acute pain,
secure, if possible, the services of a trained nurse.
Apart from her superior knowledge of means for
giving relief, the patient will be much more
likely to yield to the authority of a stranger, and
at the same time the stranger being used to the
sight of suffering, will have command over her
countenance, and will not show the distress which
it is hardly possible for inexperience to conceal.
Indeed, patients of self-controlled habits will
sometimes put such strain upon themselves to
hide their pain from too sympathising friends,
as really to increase their sufferings; whilst with
a stranger the relief of expression may safely be
indulged in. Perhaps such cases of self-repression
are rare; but at anyrate the trained nurse will
often have resources at command of which the
uninitiated know nothing, and will be able to
handle and attend to the patient with the steadiness
and tact only to be learned in the school
of experience. I admit the tender sound of the
sentiment which fancies that no hand is like the
hand of affection; but, as a practical matter, no
love, however great, can supply the place of skill
and knowledge.</p>

<p>I remember meeting with the case of a widow,
whose only son was attacked with one of the
most terrible forms of disease, accompanied with
anguish that wrung cries of agony from the strong
man’s lips. Unable to help himself, yet restless
to a painful degree, his case demanded the utmost
watchfulness and attention, in addition to which
he was of such an unselfish nature that his sufferings
became doubled as he saw their effect upon
his mother. She, ignorant as a child, refused to
listen to any suggestion of sending for a nurse;
and in answer to the remonstrances of friends,
exclaimed with indignation: ‘As though any one
could do as well for him as his mother.’ Alas!
poor fellow, it might almost have been said:
‘As though any one could do <i>worse</i> for him than
his mother;’ and none of those who witnessed the
pitiable condition he was allowed to get into, felt
any surprise at hearing him eagerly welcome death
as release from misery. I do not say that the
best of nursing would have saved his life, though
it might have given him a chance; but beyond
a doubt, skilled hands could have ministered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">{402}</span>
his wants in such a way as to have obviated a
large amount of distress and pain.</p>

<p>But apart from such grave cases, there are many
forms of illness which may safely be trusted to
home-care, provided there is a fair amount of
knowledge of those general rules which lie at the
root of all degrees of successful nursing. Not that
every woman is fitted to undertake the care of
a sick-room. A certain, and not small amount of
physical strength is absolutely needful, as well
as some special qualifications, natural or acquired,
which are equally essential. In this connection,
there is a popular fallacy which demands notice.
What a common thing it is to hear a person
described as ‘a born nurse,’ with the implication
that therefore she is fitted at any time, and under
all circumstances, to take her place in the sick-room
with confidence of success. Now, the expression
‘born’ applied to any other special calling
will show how much value it possesses. Who in
his senses would speak of the ‘born’ painter or
musician as thereby exempted from the necessity
of further training? And—to take a more homely
example—there are few mistresses, I fancy, who
would engage a servant on the sole recommendation
of being a ‘born cook!’ Yet it may easily be conceived
that the rejector of such an aspirant would
consider it natural that she should undertake more
important and delicate sick-room work, on precisely
those grounds which she rightly looks upon
as unsatisfactory in the matter of dinners. The
truth is, that in every department, those who
have special gifts require no small amount of
thoughtful care and perseverance for the
full development of their natural abilities. In
regard to nursing, the low standard of the past
has given rise to the erroneous idea of ‘birth’
qualification as supreme; but now that the
standard is becoming increasingly high, there is
good reason to hope that there will be a better
general understanding of how much scope nursing
affords for intelligence and skill; with this, too,
will come comprehension of the fact that natural
taste and ability are valuable only as grounds to
work upon.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to the consideration of
those qualifications which are essential to the good
nurse. In the first place, I would urge every
reader to cultivate <i>self-control</i> as a habit of daily
life, for without it, there will be little power of
helping in a sick-room. Not that it is always
possible to help feeling shocked and startled at
the sight of suffering, especially sudden suffering,
with which there is no familiarity; but a habit
of self-control will give power to suppress all
expression of alarm, and so to keep one’s presence
of mind as to be able to consider what means
of relief can be adopted.</p>

<p>But there are some people able to meet sudden
emergency who yet fail to keep their self-control
during the wear and tear of long illness. The
patient is irritable, seems unreasonable, and
demands constant attention; and the nurse becomes
so weary as to allow herself to show by
lagging movements or vexed looks, if not by
actual rebuke, that her work is a burden she would
willingly give up if she had the chance. Need I
say that such conduct is incompatible with good
nursing? And I cannot too strongly urge the
necessity for keeping control over face and tongue,
as well as over actions. In home-nursing this
is one of the greatest difficulties, especially where
the illness is straining resources, and there is the
additional anxiety of wondering how both ends
may be made to meet. But at any cost a nurse
must keep watch over herself, and strive after
that <i>cheerfulness</i> which is a second element in
good nursing. Perhaps only those who have
grieved over recovery retarded by the gloom and
depression of attendants, can understand the full
force of the stress I would lay upon the duty of
keeping a bright face and cheerful voice. No
amount of devotion in other respects can atone for
their absence. It is possible for a nurse to spend
time and strength lavishly in day and night vigils,
to be the best of poultice-makers, and the most
careful administrator of food and medicine, and yet
to fail utterly in helping the patient back to health
and strength. Over and over again I have found
patients sorrowful, perhaps crying, over the sense
of being ‘such a burden;’ this, too, where there
has been real affection on the part of nurses,
but where the first duties of self-control and
cheerfulness have been neither understood nor
practised.</p>

<p>Of a kindred nature is the third requisite,
<i>patience</i>, a virtue which is sure to be largely
needed in most forms of illness. Even where a
nurse is fortunate enough to have to deal with
an amiable, unexacting spirit, the hundred-and-one
details of daily nursing are apt to become
very wearisome to those unaccustomed to minute
and monotonous duties, and the temptation is
strong to hurry the patient or to slur over details.
I have seen a patient’s languid appetite chased
away by his nurse’s evident anxiety to regain
possession of cup or plate; and where having the
hair brushed is the one pleasure of the day, the
admonition to ‘be quick and turn your head’
does not give an added charm to the operation.</p>

<p>But, unhappily, the patience is sometimes tested
in a far more trying way. Apart from the helpless
tediousness of a long illness, which alone
may affect the patient’s temper and cause varying
degrees of irritability, there is, with some diseases,
an accompanying fretfulness or moodiness
most difficult to manage. So marked may this
become, that occasionally the patient seems to
have changed his character, and the most amiable
and unselfish in health may become the most
impatient and exacting in illness. The trained
nurse, accustomed to watch the effects of disease,
will understand and make allowance for such
perversion; but in private nursing I have known
patients’ friends suffer acutely from manifestations
of ill-temper, for which they could only account
on moral grounds. To the inexperienced, I
would say: remember how closely body and soul
are bound together, and believe that the <i>changed</i>
temper is only a fresh symptom to be reported
to the doctor as faithfully as any alteration in
the bodily condition. But even taking this view,
it is trying not to be able to do or say the right
thing, to have the kindest actions misconstrued,
and perhaps to hear of complaints made against
you in your absence. Your best help will be to
keep constantly in mind the fact that it is your
patient’s misfortune, and not his fault, and that
it causes him far more discomfort than it does
you. So, be very careful not to aggravate him
by opposition or by reference to exciting topics;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">{403}</span>
answer quietly, and at once, his most vexing
speeches, but as far as possible, do not argue
about even the most irrational statements. If
you are blessed with tact as well as patience,
you may be able to divert attention, and lead
to happier channels of thought, always bearing
in mind that you can do no greater kindness than
to lead your patient away from his misery. This
is a point so often overlooked, that it will bear
dwelling upon, for the nurse’s own discomfort
under such a dispensation is so great, that she
is very apt to forget that the patient’s impressions
are as real to him as though they were actual
facts, and that he fully believes it, when he
declares that you are trying your hardest to
worry and annoy him, and not to let him get
well. Think of the wretchedness of such a belief,
and spare no pains to soothe and compose the
sufferer.</p>

<p>At the same time, there is such a thing as
spoiling a patient, even though he be past the
age we generally associate with the word ‘spoil.’
Illness often brings back some of the wayward
peevishness of childhood, and you get such things
to contend with as positive refusal to take food
or medicine, or to comply with some order of
the doctor’s. How to meet these special difficulties
we will consider later on; but as regards the
question of how far to give in to a patient’s whims
and fancies, there is no better general rule than
this: oppose his wishes only on questions of
right and wrong; and when opposition becomes
a necessity, use special efforts so to keep your
self-control as to avoid all expression of anger
or impatience. How far you succeed in steering
your patient through such troubled waters will
depend greatly upon what measure you possess
of that invaluable gift, <i>sympathy</i>—in other words,
the power of putting yourself in another’s place,
seeing from his point of view, and feeling with
him in his difficulties. A hard, cold, or even a
merely narrow nature cannot be trained into
a really good nurse; and indeed, as a broad rule,
lack of health and lack of sympathy are the only
two absolutely insurmountable obstacles in the
way of those who desire to be helpful in the sick-room.
For observe that the other qualities I have
named—self-control, cheerfulness, and patience—though
much easier to some than to others,
are within the reach of all who earnestly strive
to possess them; and moreover, each and all are
capable of being developed and cultivated to an
almost unlimited extent. Sympathy, on the other
hand, though capable of development by its
fortunate possessor, is one of those natural gifts
which no amount of training can impart, and
which is no more within the reach of all than
is that good health without which attempts at
nursing cannot but end in failure. Given these
two special gifts of health and sympathy, and
you have the ‘born nurse,’ needing, indeed, much
patient care and training, but one who may
confidently count upon success.</p>

<p>Various other qualities and habits, such as
humility, gentleness, firmness, order, and accuracy,
are useful in nursing, and to these we shall refer
in giving more specific details of a nurse’s work.
There are also various gifts, as good hearing and
sight, cleverness of fingers, and natural quickness
of apprehension and of movement, which, though
very desirable, are not absolutely indispensable,
and on these it is not necessary to dwell.
Those who have them may rejoice; and those
who have not, need not be disheartened, as
they can very well be dispensed with, provided
there is thorough, conscientious effort made to
acquire those more necessary things which are to
be had for the trying.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.—IS IT TOO LATE?</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">There</span> was nobody in the house, Mr Culver;
but I knew you would be here, and so came on.—Where
is Pansy?’</p>

<p>Thus Madge, as she entered the vine-house,
where Sam, the Scotch gardener, standing on
steps, was busy amongst rich clusters of grapes.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s you, Missy. Good-day to you,’ he
answered, looking over his shoulder with that
serious contraction of the muscles of his thin
face which friends accepted as a smile. ‘This is
washing-day; and if Pansy is no in the house,
she’ll be on the green wi’ the clothes.’</p>

<p>‘I shall find her; but I am glad to have an
opportunity of speaking to you first. Can you
spare five minutes?’</p>

<p>‘Ten, or more, if it be to pleasure you, Missy,’
answered the gardener, with as near an approach
to gallantry as he had ever made. He came down
from the steps, and dusted them carefully with
his apron. ‘I have no chair to offer you; but
you can take a rest here, if you’re no owre
proud.’</p>

<p>‘You will not think that of me,’ she said,
smiling, ‘although I prefer to stand.’</p>

<p>‘Please yoursel’, Missy, just please yoursel’, and
you’ll no dee in the pet. That’s what I aye say
to onybody that maun hae their ain way.’</p>

<p>‘And what do you say to those who cannot
have their own way?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I say to them, you’ll just hae to do as
you are bidden.’</p>

<p>‘Is that what you would say to Pansy, if she
wanted very much to have her own way about
something?’</p>

<p>‘That would depend on what was the way she
wanted,’ was the cautious reply.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr Culver, I am going to do what will
offend you’——</p>

<p>‘That’s no possible.’</p>

<p>‘Or what you will take as a proof of my
liking for Pansy, according to the light in which
you regard it. At anyrate, I hope you won’t be
annoyed with me.’</p>

<p>‘No a bit, no a bit, whatever it be.—But what
is’t?’</p>

<p>‘Pansy does not know that I am going to speak
to you about it, so you must not be displeased
with her, whatever you may think of me. Philip
says there can be no harm in speaking to you,
and wishes me to do it.’</p>

<p>‘Guid-sake!—is there onything wrang?’</p>

<p>‘No, no; <i>we</i> think everything is right, and
that they will be a very happy couple. Have
you never considered that Pansy will want to
marry some day?’</p>

<p>Sam was relieved. Although Madge had been
speaking with a smile on her face all the time,
he had been a little puzzled, and for a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">{404}</span>
vaguely alarmed on his daughter’s account.
When he heard this question from her, he began
to understand.</p>

<p>‘Ay, whiles the notion has come into my head—she’s
a bonnie lass and a guid lass, and it’s
natural for women-folk to think about marriage.
But it appeared to me that there was time enough
to fash about thae things, and I just let the notion
gang by.’</p>

<p>‘But you will have to consider it seriously—and
soon. Suppose the man she wanted did not
please you: would you say that she must do as
she is bid, and refuse him?’</p>

<p>Sam took up the dead stem of a fern, and
whilst he was breaking it into small pieces,
considered very wisely.</p>

<p>‘Wha is the man?’ he asked abruptly, comprehending
what Madge was hesitating to explain,
and coming to the point at once.</p>

<p>‘He had the misfortune to offend some people
who did not understand him, but I hope you
are not one of them: I am sure you will not
be when you know him. It is Caleb Kersey.’</p>

<p>Sam looked stolidly at the ground; no surprise,
pleasure, or displeasure expressed on his features.
Madge observing him closely, was busy collecting
her arguments in favour of Caleb.</p>

<p>‘Now, that’s very queer,’ he began slowly.
‘When he was coming about the house at first,
I suspected that he was hankering after my lassie,
and I’m obliged to own that it wasna exactly
the kind o’ match that I would have liked her
to make; but when she was spoken to, she just
said nothing. Syne, thinking that there was nae
harm in his coming, and seeing what fine work
he was making of the harvest, I took a notion
o’ the lad because he was fond o’ flowers—
especially geraaniums. Do ye know, daft-like as
it was, I thought it was the geraaniums he had
a fancy for.’</p>

<p>There was a comic pathos in the air of
dejection and disappointment with which he made
this confession, whilst he rubbed his soft cap
slowly over his head, as if he would rub out the
stupidity which had caused him to make such
a mistake.</p>

<p>‘I have no doubt that the geraniums had something
to do with bringing him here,’ was the
consolatory comment of Madge. ‘You may be
certain that Caleb would never say he liked
anything if he did not. His outspoken ways are
the causes of the ill-favour he has fallen into
amongst the farmers. You know as well as I
do that he is a good worker; he is steady; and
Philip bids me assure you that he is now in a
position which he is exactly fitted for, and he
will be able to earn a good wage. I believe
that Pansy likes him, and that they are both
held back from speaking because they are afraid
of you.’</p>

<p>‘Feared for me! How can that be? I never
did anything to scare them; and I’m sure I have
ta’en mair pains in letting him into a’ the secrets
of the culture of geraaniums than I ever did wi’
onybody afore. Maybe I should have tried him
wi’ the pansies.’</p>

<p>‘He has found out that secret for himself,’ said
Madge merrily as Sam chuckled at his own little
joke. ‘Then I may tell them that you will not
be cruel—that you will not interfere with them?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if the young folk have settled the matter
for themsel’s, there would be no use of me
interfering; and if they ha’ena, there’ll be no
need.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell you how much pleasure you have
given me, Mr Culver; and Philip will be delighted,
for he began to think that poor Caleb was going
to be ruined by his anxiety about this matter.
I must go and find Pansy now.’</p>

<p>‘But there is no need to be in haste about it,’
said the gardener, and there was evidently some
anxiety underneath his dry manner: ‘she is a
young thing yet, and I’m no sure that I could get
on without her.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you would not require to be separated
from her; but all that can be arranged by-and-by.’</p>

<p>As Madge quitted the vine-house, she was aware
that Sam was meditatively rubbing his head with
his cap, and she heard him muttering: ‘Ay, ay,
it wasna the geraaniums after a’. Weel, weel, weel;
I daursay it’s natural.’ He always returned to
his native dialect when speaking familiarly, or
when under the influence of emotion whether of
affection or rage.</p>

<p>The washing-house was a small erection jutting
out from the back of the cottage, and thither
Madge hastened with the agreeable news, which
she believed was to make two young people
‘happy ever after.’ The door stood wide open as
she approached, but a mist of steam hid everything
within, and boiling water running over
the floor prevented her from entering. A figure
appeared in the mist—stooped—groped for something—and
presently darted out, stumbling against
Madge.</p>

<p>‘Why, Pansy, what in the world is the matter?’</p>

<p>The girl was flushed and panting with excitement.</p>

<p>‘I am so stupid to-day.—I hope I did not hurt
you,’ she gasped. ‘The tap of the boiler—I forgot
to turn it off; and the place was full of steam in a
minute, and I’ve upset the tub on the floor, and
dirtied all the clothes. O dear!’</p>

<p>‘Never mind about the clothes. You might
have been suffocated or scalded to death. Are
you burned?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I think my hand was a little,
when I turned off the tap just now.... O dear!
I am so stupid to-day.’</p>

<p>The left hand was already puffed up with a
white swelling, which looked more dangerous than
it was in reality. Madge hurried her into the
cottage, and poured oil over the scalded hand into
a bowl. When the bowl was half-full of oil, she
bade the girl keep her hand in it. Pansy submitted
with a patience that was akin to indifference;
but as she continued at intervals to utter
little cries of distress, it was some time before
Madge became aware that they had nothing to do
with the injury the girl had sustained. She did
not look at her hand at all, but stared at the
window, as if she saw something outside that
made her unhappy.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you have not got any lint in the
house. Well, you must find a bit of soft rag; and
when we have steeped it in the oil, I will fasten
it on your hand until we get Dr Joy to dress it
properly. You can walk down to the village with
me.’</p>

<p>‘It’s no use—it doesn’t matter. I must finish
the washing.... O dear!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">{405}</span></p>

<p>‘Is it paining you very much?’</p>

<p>‘O yes.—He looked so bad, that it scared me to
see him; and I ran away, and I don’t know what
I was doing.’</p>

<p>‘Who are you talking about?’ asked Madge,
alarmed lest the girl’s fright was to have more
serious consequences than she had anticipated.</p>

<p>‘About <i>him</i>—Caleb.’</p>

<p>Her eyes were still fixed on the window; and
observing this, Madge also glanced in that direction,
half expecting to see the lover outside. Seeing
no one, she became more and more uneasy
about Pansy’s odd behaviour.</p>

<p>‘He will come soon,’ she said cheeringly; ‘and
I have great news for you and for him. You
would never guess what it is.’</p>

<p>‘No; I never would guess. I am not able to
try.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, you will have all the more pleasure
in the surprise. I always knew your father was
a sensible and just man, who would never allow
any prejudice to affect his judgment of others; but
he did surprise me when I spoke to him about
you and Caleb. He gave me leave to tell you that
he will not interfere between you. Now, is not
that great news!’</p>

<p>Madge expected to see her flush with joy and
rouse from the dazed state into which she had
fallen. Instead of that, Pansy started to her feet,
pale, and all consciousness of the scalded hand
had evidently vanished.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to hear that.’</p>

<p>‘Sorry!... Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because I am not going to have him,’ was the
half-petulant, half-sobbing answer.</p>

<p>‘O Pansy, what is this?’ exclaimed Madge
astonished, puzzled and regretful. ‘When we last
spoke about him, you made me believe that you
liked him very much, and that you only hesitated
because you were afraid your father would not
be pleased.’</p>

<p>‘And I do like him—like him so much, that
it upsets me to put him out or trouble him. But
I’m not going to have him, and I’ve told him so.
He was asking me just before you came, and—and
I told him.’</p>

<p>There was real distress in voice and look; but
there was an under-current of sulky defiance, as
if being conscious that she had not behaved well
to the man, she was eager to defend herself, and
finding no ready way of doing it, was angry with
herself whilst ready to anticipate blame.</p>

<p>Madge’s expression of astonishment changed
to one of grave concern, although Pansy’s confession
of anxiety to spare Caleb suggested that there
was nothing worse to apprehend than some misunderstanding
between the lovers, which would
be put right as soon as the girl got over her excitement.
So she proceeded quietly to bandage the
injured hand, without speaking for several minutes.
Pansy was evidently unhappy; the silence of her
friend was a more severe rebuke than any words
of blame could have been. She could endure it
no longer.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what shall I do?’ she burst out; ‘<i>you</i>
are vexed with me now, like him.’</p>

<p>‘You must not think that, Pansy. I am very
much grieved to see you in such a state as this;
but I am sure it only needs a little forbearance
on your part to put everything right again.
There is nothing uncommon in a little tiff between
lovers, and you will soon get over it. I will
answer for Caleb that he will be ready to make
it up as soon as you speak a kind word to
him.’</p>

<p>‘But I can’t speak the word he wants, for I am
not to have him.’</p>

<p>That was sufficiently decisive. Then Madge
examined her closely, and became very anxious,
for she perceived that Pansy’s distress had a
deeper source than ‘a little tiff.’</p>

<p>‘You do not mean to say that Caleb is not the
one you care most for?’</p>

<p>There was sullen silence.</p>

<p>Now, of all the feminine frailties which nature
and training had taught Madge to shun, coquetry
stood foremost. An acted falsehood!—What
could be more abominable? A falsehood which,
by inspiring baseless hopes, may cause an honest
heart long days and nights of pain, when the
truth becomes known? Can there be pleasure
in seeing another suffer? There are women
who consider coquetting with any decent-looking
fellow a legitimate form of amusement, and avail
themselves of it without a suspicion of immodesty
or a single pang of conscience; yet the same
women would scream at a mouse or at sight of
a bleeding scratch. Demure glances, soft tones,
a confiding touch on the arm—meaning nothing
more than to gratify a mania for admiration at
any cost—have played the mischief in high and
low life many a time.</p>

<p>If anybody might claim a privilege to coquet,
Pansy might, for she had been praised and
flattered by everybody, whilst she had been
guarded by her father as if she had been a flower
almost too precious for the common eye. Hitherto,
she had shown few symptoms of the weakness
which too often makes such a position dangerous.
Although there were many lads in the district
who would fain have been suitors, not one dare
say that she had deceived him by word or look.
Caleb Kersey could say it now.</p>

<p>‘Come and sit down, Pansy, and let us talk
about this; you will feel better when you have
told me all about it. Besides, it will do you good
to have a little rest before we start for the
doctor’s.’</p>

<p>There was really no need to hurry to the
doctor, as the wound had been dressed so cleverly.
Madge drew her gently down on the chair and,
holding her hand sympathetically, waited. Like
a glow of sunlight breaking through a rain-cloud,
the sullen gloom was dispersed with a sob and
a burst of tears. Pansy’s head rested on her
friend’s shoulder, whilst she clutched her hand, as
if seeking courage and support in the assurance
of her presence. The time for words had not
come yet.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the girl lifted her head and wiped
her eyes with a corner of the big white apron
which covered her from the neck to the ankle.</p>

<p>‘I’m right ashamed at myself for taking on
this way—that I am,’ she said bashfully; ‘and
there ain’t no reason in it either, barring that I’m
vexed for vexing him, and that he’ll feel worse
when he finds there’s no help for it.’</p>

<p>‘Why have you not answered my question,
Pansy?’</p>

<p>‘There ain’t no answer.’</p>

<p>‘Somebody else has spoken to you before Caleb,
and has been luckier than he.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">{406}</span></p>

<p>‘Nobody else has spoken to me—if you mean
in the way of asking me.’</p>

<p>This cleared away a simoom of disagreeable
speculations which had been whirling through
Madge’s brain. Caleb’s happiness was not wrecked
yet.</p>

<p>‘And there is nobody you expect to ask you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t say that—I don’t know. Who
can tell what may happen? But there’s no use
speaking about that. I wish things hadn’t gone
so far with Caleb.’</p>

<p>Madge agreed that there was no use speaking
any more at present; but although she did not
feel quite so assured as she had done a moment
before of Caleb’s speedy restoration to favour, she
was hopeful that he would be in the end, since
no one else had spoken. At the same time, she
was satisfied that there was another who had
contrived to catch the wayward fancy of the girl
by touching some hidden spring of vanity.
Worst of all, there was the unpleasant probability
that this ‘other’ who disturbed the peace of two
honest folk was one whose position was so
different from her own that the girl was afraid
or ashamed to confess her folly at once. But this
would be transient, and Pansy would come back
to her senses in good time. Clearly, whatever
silly notions possessed her for the moment, it was
Caleb she loved, or she would never have been
so much worried on his account.</p>

<p>Having, however, some conception of the headstrong
nature of the man, Madge was aware
of the importance of promptitude in clearing up
the misunderstanding between the lovers, and
she did not see how that could be done unless
Caleb remained steady and patient. She and
Philip must persuade him to be so. For the
present, nothing more could be said to Pansy with
advantage.</p>

<p>The girl was glad of the excuse to go to the
doctor’s, as it afforded her time to recover self-possession
before she came under the keen eyes
of her father. On their way through the forest,
no further reference was made to Caleb, although
Madge talked about Philip’s work, and the happy
future which they believed was in store for every
man who laboured under him. Of course she
intended her companion to understand that Caleb
would share largely in that brilliant future.
Whether it was this suggestion or the brisk
exercise which had the effect, Pansy looked
sufficiently composed on their arrival in the
village not to attract the particular attention of
passing acquaintances.</p>

<p>The injured hand was attended to, and Dr
Joy complimented Madge on her skill as a
dresser.</p>

<p>‘There will be no need to ask you to come to
my lecture on the art of dressing ordinary
wounds,’ said the little doctor gallantly; ‘but
I hope you will come, for I shall then feel that
there will be at least two people in the room who
have some idea of the subject—you and the
lecturer. Meanwhile, you are not to go away
without seeing Mrs Joy. She has one of her
patients with her—a poor woman who has got
into a dreadful muddle with her domestic economies.
What a pity that we cannot get the simple
rule driven into their heads, that a penny saved
is a penny gained.—That’s her going now. Come
this way; and you’ll excuse me—I have a couple
of patients to see immediately.—My dear, here
is Miss Heathcote with Pansy Culver.’</p>

<p>The doctor hurried away as Mrs Joy advanced
with both hands extended to Madge.</p>

<p>‘I am so delighted to see you, dear; I have’——
She interrupted herself, and without releasing
Madge’s hands, said in parenthesis: ‘How do
you do, Pansy; and how is your father? Please
sit down.’ Without waiting for a reply, she proceeded
with what she had been about to say to
Madge. ‘I have such an interesting case to
report to you. Of course you remember Edwin’s
lecture last year called “Penny wise and Pound
saved”—that is his playful way of dealing with
that wicked saying of “penny wise and pound
foolish,” which has done incalculable harm to
poor people—and rich people too, I am sure.
You remember it?’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to have to own that I missed the
lecture.’</p>

<p>‘What a pity! However, there was a poor
labourer present—Wolden is his name—and he
was so deeply impressed by what he heard, that
he determined to lay by one penny regularly
every week. That is a most gratifying proof
of the benefit of real practical counsel: but what
is most gratifying is that the man actually carried
out his good resolution. Think of that! He has
fourteen shillings a week, and out of each payment
he regularly put by one penny in a hole
above the fireplace, which was only known to
himself and his wife. Well, he kept to his good
resolution in spite of many temptations, and he
only wanted three weeks to make out a complete
year of that noble self-denial. Think!—what a
glorious proof of the value of the lessons which
Edwin and I have been teaching. This man,
who never before had a shilling he could call
his own, had actually stored away in the course
of forty-nine weeks four shillings and one penny!...
It is so delightfully marvellous to observe
how atoms grow and multiply into mountains!’</p>

<p>Mrs Joy was so much pleased with the idea
which the last words conveyed to herself, that
she paused to repeat and admire them with a
view to their future use when she should offer
herself as a candidate for the local School-board.</p>

<p>‘The doctor and you must be greatly pleased,’
said Madge, cordially appreciating the effect of
Dr Joy’s wise admonitions.</p>

<p>‘We are—we were; but’—here Mrs Joy shook
her head with a smiling regretfulness at being
obliged to own the existence of human weakness—‘but
to-day there came to him a friend who required
him to take a parcel into London—a parcel for
a friend of yours, Mr Philip Hadleigh. His fare
there and back was to be paid, and half-a-crown
for the service. Wolden had often thought, if he
were in London, he would buy something useful
with his savings. Here was the opportunity. He
ran home for his savings; and what did he find?
The hole in the wall was empty; and his wife was
obliged to own that she had used the money for a
pair of boots for one of the children. Think!’</p>

<p>Madge did think; but it was not about the
doctor’s lecture or the misfortune of his convert—it
was about the person who had been suddenly
employed to carry a parcel to Philip. Pansy’s
thoughts jumped in the same direction.</p>

<p>‘How unfortunate,’ said Madge; ‘the poor man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">{407}</span>
disappointment must have been awful. But who
gave him the parcel for—Mr Hadleigh?’</p>

<p>‘Most unfortunate—terribly disappointing,’ proceeded
Mrs Joy, apparently unconscious of the
question which had been asked. ‘The man
became so wild, that the poor woman ran out
of the house and came to me for advice and
assistance. I scolded her, I can tell you—scolded
her roundly for having deceived her husband in
such a way. She was very penitent. I always
scold, and they are always penitent. She promised
never to do anything of the kind again; and I
gave her the money, in order that she might
start on her new course with a clear conscience.
You should have seen how grateful she was,
dear; and it is most delicious to feel that one
can save a household from destruction by such
simple means—good advice and four shillings and
a penny!’</p>

<p>Mrs Joy was so lost in contemplation of the
small expense at which morals and domestic economy
could be instilled into the minds of the
people, that she did not observe the anxious
expression of Madge, or the frightened look of
Pansy.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Mrs Joy, but I have a reason for
again asking you who was the sender of the parcel
to Mr Hadleigh?’ said Madge.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how ridiculous of me to forget. It was
Caleb Kersey.—It seems that he has some idea
of emigration; and this poor fellow Wolden caught
up the notion, and threatened to leave his wife
and family to the parish. That was what put
the woman in such a state; but he will stay at
home now that he has got back his four shillings
and a penny.’</p>

<p>‘Caleb Kersey going to emigrate!’</p>

<p>‘That was what she said.’</p>

<p>Madge looked at Pansy. Her face was white
and lips quivering.</p>

<p>‘Will you excuse us, Mrs Joy? We must go
now.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_LEGAL_DECISIONS">SOME LEGAL DECISIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Theoretically</span>, every one is supposed to be
familiar with the law of the land he lives in, and
to know exactly what he may do unto others, and
what others may do unto him. Practically, lawyers
themselves have too often to acquire that knowledge
at the expense of a client, the burden of
whose song might be, ‘From court to court they
hurry me,’ if Law were not much too dignified
a dame to hurry herself or those having dealings
with her.</p>

<p>It was not until the matter had been disputed
for a couple of centuries, that it was settled that
‘from the date’ and ‘on and from the date’ were
synonymous phrases. But for the perseverance
of a stubborn gentleman, who was not satisfied
by being beaten in two courts out of three, we
should not now know wherever the words ‘value’
or ‘annual value’ are used in a statute that they
mean ‘net,’ not ‘gross’ value. It took the
Canadian Court of Queen’s Bench half a year to
decide whether ‘Old Tom’ came under the definition
of ‘spirits.’ A majority of experts were of
opinion that it did not, being only a compound
of spirits, sugar, and flavouring matter; but the
Court ultimately decreed that Old Tom belonged
to the family of spirits, and that to hold otherwise
would be a mere trifling with words.</p>

<p>The courts of the United States have found
it more difficult to settle what is and is not a
‘saloon.’ In Michigan, it may be a place for the
sale of liquors, or it may be a place for the sale of
general refreshments. In Texas, a saloon may
be a room for the reception of company, or one
set apart for the exhibition of works of art. The
legal luminaries of Connecticut hold that neither
an inclosed park nor an uninclosed platform,
where lager beer is retailed, can be considered to
be a saloon, house, or building, within the
meaning of the statute forbidding the sale of
intoxicating liquors upon Sunday; while in
Massachusetts it has been declared that a cellar
is a house, when used for that purpose. In New
Hampshire, ‘spirituous liquors’ are not to be
confounded with ‘fermented liquors.’ In Indiana,
the mere opinion of a witness that brewer’s beer
is intoxicating is no sufficient proof that it is so,
unless that opinion is founded on personal experience
of its effects; but in Massachusetts, the evidence
of a man who had merely smelt some ale
was accepted as proof of its overcoming quality.
In Iowa, wine is not an intoxicating drink if made
from grapes, currants, or other fruits grown
within the state; while in Maine, wine and cider
of native growth are intoxicating liquors—if a
jury chooses to think them so.</p>

<p>What is a date? Certain would-be voters for
Marylebone sent in their claims, properly filled
up and signed, but dated merely ‘August 1883.’
After a week’s cogitation, the revising barrister
came to the conclusion that that was a sufficient
date, as it showed that the claims were made
between the first and the twenty-fifth of August,
as required by the Act; the fact of their being
in the hands of the overseers proving delivery on
or before the twenty-fifth day of the month.
What is a vacant and what an unoccupied house,
were two questions submitted to a court in the
United States, under rather peculiar circumstances.
A gentleman owning a house in which
he and his family lived from May to November,
left it for the rest of the year to be looked after
by a farmer living near, visiting it occasionally
himself to see that all was right. This house he
insured under two separate policies. It was
burned down; and when called upon to pay, the
insurers repudiated all liability. By the terms
of one policy they undertook to make good the
value of the house, if burned, ‘unless it should
become vacant <i>or</i> unoccupied;’ by the terms of
the other, their liability ceased if the house
‘became vacant <i>and</i> unoccupied.’ The court
determined that no claim could arise on the first
policy, since, to be occupied, a house must have
human beings in it, using it as their customary
abode; but the Company was liable under the
second policy, as, although the house was unoccupied,
it was not vacant, so long as the furniture
and cooking-utensils were in it.</p>

<p>A very nice question was raised by an English
Accident Insurance Company, anxious to escape
paying a thousand pounds to the representatives
of a policy-holder who was drowned in a river
near Edgbaston. It was contended that the
unfortunate man fell into the shallow stream,
and was suffocated through being unable to raise
his head above the water from exhaustion caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">{408}</span>
by a fit; and that the Company was not liable
for any injury consequent upon natural disease
or exhaustion, while one of the conditions of the
policy specified that no claim should arise ‘for
any injury from any accident, unless such accident
shall be caused by some outward and visible
means.’ The court held that the insured died
from drowning in a brook while in an epileptic
fit, and drowning had been decided to be an
injury caused by an accident from outward and
visible means. The death did not come within
the words ‘natural disease or exhaustion,’ but
resulted from an accident, which was drowning,
and the Company must pay.</p>

<p>Thief-catching is best left to the police, amateurs
may so easily overreach themselves. Hearing a
noise outside their house, after they had gone to
rest, a worthy couple arose, and ascertaining that a
man was prowling around, came to the conclusion
he was bent upon robbery; so they unbolted the
outer door, and waited. Sure enough, the man
entered, was promptly seized, handed over to the
police, and committed for trial at the Manchester
assizes; but the grand-jury, under the judge’s
instructions, threw out the bill—the accused could
not be charged with breaking into a house which
he had entered by merely raising the latch. As
lucky a let-off awaited the American actor Frayne,
when arraigned for the manslaughter of Miss
Behren, by shooting her upon the stage, in performing
a modern version of Tell’s feat. The
defence was, that Frayne did not point his rifle at
the actress, but at an apple a few inches above
her head; and the court holding that the gun
being pointed at an object, and not at the person,
there could be no charge of manslaughter, the
prisoner must be discharged.</p>

<p>Some recent decisions of the courts of the United
States are notable for their common-sense. In a
lawsuit against a Railway Company, in which the
relatives of a young man who had been run down
by a train, sought to recover ten thousand dollars
by way of compensation for their loss, Judge Love
gave judgment in favour of the Company, saying,
the young man had no business walking on other
people’s property, while the Company did have
business running its trains there; a railway is
not a public highway, but private property, and
people must not trespass. In another court it
was decided that a Telegraph Company could
not limit its liability by printing on its forms
a notice disclaiming responsibility for mistakes
unless the message was repeated—of course, at
the customer’s cost. Any rule or regulation
seeking to relieve the Company from performing
its duty with integrity, skill, and diligence, was
in contravention of public policy; and if it were
necessary, in order to secure correctness, to repeat
a message, the duty of repeating it devolved
upon the Company. Per contra, a Company’s
customers must use their rights with discretion.
A subscriber to the telephone in Cincinnati was
deprived of his privilege by the Company because
of his using a word—which is too frequently
in the mouths of Englishmen—in his communications.
He sued to be reinstated. One judge
said the obnoxious word was not profane according
either to the decalogue, the dictionary,
common law, or statute law; but the majority
of the court were of a different way of thinking,
and declared the word to be coarse, unbecoming,
and profane, or if not profane, improper.
The rule prohibiting improper language was a
reasonable one. The telephone reached into all
classes of society, and into many family circles.
It is possible for a communication intended for
one individual to reach another. Moreover, the
operators are in many cases refined ladies, and
even beyond this, all operators are to be protected
from insult. The inventors, too, have a right
to be protected, and to have the instrument
placed in a respectable light before the world,
otherwise it might go out of use. For all which
reasons they concurred in non-suiting the profane
plaintiff.</p>

<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">I can’t</span> stand it any longer, and I won’t! It
isn’t so much that he jeers at me and ill-treats
me; perhaps I could manage to put up with that,
if he gave me a kind word now and then, and
didn’t leave me so much alone. But he is away
sometimes for days and nights together; and
where he goes to I don’t know, though of course
I can guess pretty well; and he will never tell
me anything except to mind my own business.
And when he <i>is</i> at home, he never speaks except
to taunt and sneer at me because I’m not a lady,
as he says. He hates me, and I’ve come to hate
him, and I’m afraid of my life with him. You
can’t imagine what he’s like when he’s in a
temper. I cannot, indeed, bring myself to tell
you of all the shame and the infamy he puts
upon me.’ And the Honourable Mrs Ferrard
buried her face in her hands and sobbed despairingly.</p>

<p>Mr Cross, auctioneer, rested his great square
chin on his hands, and gazed across his library
table at the flushed and weeping figure before
him. ‘So it has come to this at last, Amy?’ he
said. ‘You deceived and disobeyed your old
father, that loved you, and deserted him, and
pretty well broke his heart, all for the sake of
this grand husband of yours; and now you have
to come to me to help you against him. Well,
well; I’m not a bit surprised, my girl. I’ve
been expecting you. I wasn’t coming to you,
you know; I knew you would have to come to
me, sooner or later. Now, sit still and quiet
yourself, while I think a bit.’</p>

<p>He continued to gaze across his writing-table,
but with eyes that saw nothing. This was his
only child, all that was left to him of her dead
mother; and he had loved her, and still loved
her, with an intensity which her insignificant
little intelligence was far from comprehending.
It had been his study from her childhood to
gratify every fancy which entered her shallow
pate; all that money could buy had been
lavished upon her—except the training and
education of a lady. ‘I’m not going to have
my girl,’ said he, ‘brought up so that she’ll
be ashamed of her father and her father’s
friends. No; let her learn to play the piano, if
she cares to—I always liked a good tune—and to
draw and paint and talk French, so that it don’t
worry her. But none of your fine finishing
schools for me, where she’ll mix with a lot of
stuck-up fools and get all sorts of notions into
her head.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">{409}</span></p>

<p>So Amy Cross went to a very respectable establishment
in North London, where she acquired,
to a limited extent, all the above accomplishments;
and was sent back to her home very
pretty, vain, and vulgar, very proud of her piano
and her French, and without a single useful or
graceful idea in her head.</p>

<p>This being so, it was not perhaps to be
wondered at that Miss Amy Cross should fall
an easy victim to the wiles of Lord Englethorpe’s
youngest son, the Honourable James Ferrard.
That gentleman was at Canterbury, attending the
races at Barham Downs with a kindred spirit of
his former regiment (then quartered in that city);
his commission in which he had been permitted—and
only just permitted—to resign; and it had
occurred to him that it would be amusing to run
over to Margate and contend for a time with
humbler Don Juans for the smiles of the Cockney
beauties of the place. It so happened that Amy
was just then staying there with some relations;
and the two met on the jetty, and were mutually
attracted by one another’s good looks. The gallant
captain found no difficulty in introducing
himself both to the girl and her friends; on all
of whom his appearance and manner—so different
from those of the gentlemen of <i>their</i> society—made
a most favourable impression. They met
frequently; and he soon succeeded in captivating
the heart of poor Amy.</p>

<p>It is due to the captain’s pride of birth and
ancestry to say that, at first, flirtation and not
marriage was in his thoughts. But when he
discovered that the girl’s father was a man of
very great wealth, and that she was an only child,
he began to think that the game might be worth
keeping up in London, with a view to honourable
matrimony, immediate comfort, and succession in
the future to the old man’s money. For it would
have been difficult for Captain Ferrard to have
indicated with any precision his present means
of existence. It was notorious that his family
had long declined to hold any communication
with him, further than that the earl allowed
him the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds
a year, which indeed was all that he could afford,
being—for a peer—almost penniless, with a good
many children to provide for. The sum named
was about enough to keep the young gentleman
in gloves and cigars. The balance of his
expenditure had to be made up by means of
credit, the turf, billiards, pigeon-shooting, and
cards. But the first was nearly at an end; the
second required capital; the next two are not
improved by overmuch tobacco and brandy;
and at the fifth the captain was becoming a
little too skilful. He was in a desperate state.
Why should he not betake himself to his last
weapon? He was twenty-eight, with a manly
and well-made figure, smooth-faced as a boy of
eighteen, brilliant of complexion, with eyes of a
peculiarly dark blue. It was more the face of a
beautiful woman than that of a man; but there
was something wrong about it. The forehead was
too retreating, the mouth too hard, and too often
expanded in a smile. His manner and bearing
were extremely pleasant and ingratiatory. How
should an ignorant little girl, fresh from a North
London seminary, or her auctioneering papa,
detect the festering vices and the cruel heart
beneath that fair outside? So he asked permission
to call on Miss Cross in London, and readily
obtained it.</p>

<p>He called accordingly, saw her alone, and
made most satisfactory progress. The second
time, he was introduced to papa. Papa, in
fact, having heard of the former visit, and
knowing the visitor well by repute through
certain bill-discounting acquaintances, had left
instructions with a faithful retainer—the cook—that
he was to be fetched from the City immediately
on a repetition of the visit. The result
was not quite what Captain Ferrard had expected.
Papa sat glum and moody through the interview;
when it was over, he attended the visitor
to the door, and with some coarseness of manner
and roughness of tone, requested him to take
notice that his attentions were not desired. Not
all Captain Ferrard’s smoothest explanations and
assurances sufficed to appease the auctioneer, who
simply replied that he didn’t believe a word of
them; and that, supposing them to be true, his
girl did not want any fine gentleman for a husband,
least of all of the stamp of Captain Ferrard,
as to whose character and pursuits he further
expressed himself pretty roundly. The captain
answered with aristocratic contempt and insolence,
applied with an ease and absence of emotion
which reduced the auctioneer to speechless fury;
and so departed.</p>

<p>The only result of this was that the ill-regulated
girl, whose lover was the first toy which
had been denied to her, became mutinous. She
entered, first upon a clandestine correspondence,
then upon a series of secret meetings, and ultimately
left home one fine day just after she
had attained twenty-one, and was married at
a suburban church by license. Ferrard calculated
that when once the irrevocable step had
been taken, a reconciliation with her father
and a handsome dowry would be a matter of
only a few weeks, and that the plebeian alliance,
gilded with the auctioneer’s gold, would be
condoned by his family, and would even cause
him to be received by them with open arms.
But everything went wrong. The bereaved
parent, whatever may have been his sufferings
in private, did not hasten to clasp his erring
daughter to his bosom. When at last she wrote
him a letter, carefully dictated by her husband,
the only reply received was from a lawyer,
stating that Mr Cross declined all communication
with Mrs Ferrard or her husband; but
that as he did not desire that his daughter
should starve, he proposed to make to her exactly
the same allowance as her husband received from
the Earl of Englethorpe. That nobleman, who
had been waiting to see what would happen
before finally committing himself, thereupon
wrapped himself with much dignity in his
family grandeur, and refused to receive either
his son or his son’s wife, or to add a farthing to
the two hundred and fifty pounds a year.</p>

<p>All this was so far beneath the Honourable
James’s just expectations, that he became not a
little disgusted with his bargain, with the usual
results. Indifference and neglect were speedily
followed by quarrels, upbraiding, and taunts;
at last by covert, yet none the less positive,
unmanly cruelty on the part of the husband,
and a return to his former mode of life. This,
indeed, he had never really abandoned, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">{410}</span>
he had put some sort of restraint on the open
indulgence of his vices so long as it appeared
that anything might be got by doing so; and
even now, having regard to what the day might
bring forth, he was cunning and cautious to the
last degree. At length, Amy fled in despair to
her father, who received her coldly, but without
anger, in the interview with which this tale
commences.</p>

<p>Amy sat on the sofa, her wild sobs becoming
less frequent, for she saw that her father was
thinking. Weak and foolish as she was, she
instinctively appreciated his strength of character
enough to know that when Mr Cross took to
thinking, something generally happened in consequence;
and she hoped that he would find some
means of extricating her from the trouble which
she had brought upon herself.</p>

<p>Some time had gone by, and the auctioneer
remained in the same vein of thought, seemingly
forgetful of his daughter’s presence. At last she
spoke to him, and he roused himself with a
start.</p>

<p>‘Ten o’clock,’ he said, looking at his watch;
‘time you were home.’</p>

<p>‘Home, papa? I dare not. I don’t know what
he won’t do, when he finds where I’ve been, and
he’s sure to get it out of me. Oh, don’t send me
back!’ and she burst into a fresh fit of hysterical
weeping.</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush, my girl!’ he said soothingly.
‘Nonsense! A married woman oughtn’t to be
away from her husband. I’m going to write
him a letter for you to give him, and you’ll find
he won’t be so angry as you think. I suppose
you’ll see him to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. He said he should be home to-night, and
he generally is when he says so.’</p>

<p>‘That’s well,’ said the auctioneer; and sitting
down, he wrote a few lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>—I should like a word with you on family
matters, and will call on you at eleven o’clock
to-morrow.—Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">R. Cross.’</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>‘There!’ he said; ‘you give him that, and it
will quiet him down. Now, get on your bonnet,
and I’ll send for a cab.’</p>

<p>Captain Ferrard did come home, and in a very
queer temper. Before he could proceed to vent it,
his trembling wife put the note into his hand;
and with a sharp glance at her, he opened and
read it. ‘O ho!’ cried he. ‘So,’ he said, after
musing a little, ‘you have been to see papa, eh?
Singing your husband’s praises so well, that our
good papa is anxious to make his acquaintance.—Is
that it, Mrs Ferrard?’</p>

<p>She did not answer, but cast down her eyes.</p>

<p>He reflected again. ‘Well,’ he said at last, ‘I
don’t much care what you have been saying, or
what you have not. Perhaps it may turn out
to be the best thing you could have done.
Anyway, I’ll see him to-morrow—“comes he
in peace, or comes he in war”—and on his
behaviour, my pet, will depend our future happiness.—Now,
get to bed!’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Cross had returned to his old
position at the table and remained deep in
thought far into the night. He was a man strong
in his likes and dislikes, but his feelings towards
this Ferrard surprised himself. In the first place,
the man belonged to a class which the auctioneer,
with or without reason, had come to despise or
dislike. Secondly, he possessed the three vices
which are most hateful to a steady and prosperous
man of business—he was an idler, a
gambler, and a spendthrift. On the above
grounds alone, the very name of Ferrard was
obnoxious to Mr Cross. But this worthless
fellow, after coolly insulting him on his own
doorstep, had succeeded in robbing him of his
daughter—his daughter, as to whom the dream
of his life had been, that she would repay
his tenderness and care by becoming the solace
of his age, until she should be honourably and
happily married to some prosperous young votary
of commerce, and should surround him with a
troop of grandchildren, who would recall to him
their mother’s childhood. To realise such hopes,
he had worked like a slave, and had accumulated
money until his name was a proverb for wealth.
All over now—he was childless and alone with
his riches—a gloomy and cheerless old age was
coming fast upon him, and he owed it all to
this gentleman of long descent, at whose patrician
hands ill-usage and shame were his child’s
portion.</p>

<p>How should he answer her cry for aid? How
rescue her? Was it in any way—by any sacrifice—possible
to undo the miserable past; to wipe
the slate clean, and to start afresh, with the hope
of realising the old dreams? This was the
problem the auctioneer set himself to work out,
sitting there in the silence. And his heart sank,
as he bitterly acknowledged to himself that the
chances were but of the slenderest. Money would
no doubt buy the man off, so that the father
might have his girl safe in his home once more—but
not to send her from it again as the happy
wife of a husband after his own heart. Of
course, legal proceedings might be instituted;
but their success might be doubtful. The whole
of Amy’s conversation with her father has not
been detailed; but it was clear from what she
had said that the ill-treatment inflicted upon her
had been carefully confined to those petty and
spiteful persecutions which a cruel and cunning
man is so skilful in inflicting, which cause
neither wound nor bruise, elicit no cries of
anguish, yet in their power of breaking, by
constant repetition, the proudest spirit, are like
the continual dropping which wears away the
rock.</p>

<p>As he thought of these things, the heart of the
auctioneer swelled within him with perplexity and
rage. He was not a cruel or revengeful man;
he was a church-goer, and would have taken it
extremely ill if any one had told him that he was
not a Christian. Yet he did most heartily and
fervently desire that the worthless and disreputable
destroyer of his happiness would take himself
with all convenient speed out of the world, so
that the distress and difficulty which he had
originated might perish with him. ‘I wish he
were dead!’ he muttered to himself—‘I wish he
were dead!’ And the wish, once formed, refused
to quit his mind, but presented itself again and
again as an eminently desirable solution of the
whole question.</p>

<p>But Ferrard was young and strong, and not
at all likely to oblige Mr Cross by dying for
some time to come; so the auctioneer rose and
paced the room, forcing himself to regard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">{411}</span>
matter in another and more wholesome light.
He had formed no particular plan of action for
the morrow, having had in making the appointment
merely a vague idea that he would endeavour
in some way to arrange matters for his
daughter’s happiness, if money could do it. He
now told himself that, after all, Ferrard might
not be so black as he was painted. He had not,
perhaps, had a fair chance; he had been exposed,
still young, to great temptations, and had succumbed
to them. He was without a friend—a
true friend—in the world, and might well be
reckless and desperate. He, the auctioneer, would
endeavour to make his acquaintance; he would
invite him to his house; he would inquire into
his affairs; he would see whether it would be
possible to take him by the hand and—as he
phrased it—‘make a man of him.’ There would
be no harm, at anyrate, in trying to make the
best of a bad job—indeed, it was the one sorry
resource left. He could but fail; should he do
so, then it would be time to think of other
measures. What a miserable, wearing business
it all was! If that wish would but come true,
what a cutting of the knot it would be!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="PROLONGING_LIFE">PROLONGING LIFE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> possibility of prolonging human life has
undoubtedly, from the most ancient times,
afforded a fascinating and extensive field alike
for the visionary and the deepest thinkers.
Plans for prolonging existence have ever been
amongst the principal allurements held forth
by empirics and impostors; and by thus imposing
upon the credulity of the public, many
notorious charlatans have acquired rich harvests
of ill-gotten gold. Men of science have throughout
all ages devoted their attention to the subject,
as one deserving of the most profound investigation.
And their researches have been attended
with more or less benefit to posterity. We find
that Bacon himself attached so much importance
to the matter that he prosecuted inquiry in that
direction with the utmost assiduity. Although
it would be almost impossible to review all the
schemes advanced, yet a review of the most
notable theories advocated for prolongation of life
is certainly deserving of attention. At the same
time, an elucidation of their fallacies, as occasion
may arise, is of no small moment, in order to
ascertain with greater certainty their true value.
It is indeed interesting to observe the various
and often opposite means advocated by enthusiasts
for attaining the same end.</p>

<p>Even as far back as the Egyptian, Greek, and
Roman periods, we find the idea of prolonging
life prevalent. The Egyptians bestowed considerable
attention to the attainment of longevity, and
they believed that life could be prolonged through
the efficacy of sudorifics and emetics continually
used. Instead of saying, ‘How do you do?’ as an
ordinary salutation, they inquired of each other,
‘How do you perspire?’ In those days, it was
a general custom to take at least two emetics
during each month. Hippocrates and his disciples
recommended moderation in diet, friction, and
well-timed exercise, which was certainly a step
in the right direction.</p>

<p>It was during the darkness of the middle
ages, ripe with fanaticism and superstition, that
the most absurd ideas of witchcraft, horoscopes,
chiromancy, and empirical panaceas for the
prolongation of life first became disseminated.
The philosopher’s stone and elixir of life were
then vaunted by the alchemists. Foremost among
the prolongers of life we find Paracelsus, an
alchemist of great renown, and a man of considerable
attainments. He claimed to have discovered
the elixir of life. So great was his influence,
that even the learned Erasmus did not disdain to
consult him. Patients and pupils flocked around
him from every quarter of Europe. Notwithstanding
his famous ‘stone of immortality,’ he
died at the age of fifty. His vaunted elixir
was a kind of sulphur similar to compound
sulphuric ether. Nevertheless, to the researches
of Paracelsus we are indebted for our primary
knowledge of mercury, which he was the first
to use as a medicine.</p>

<p>About this epoch, one Leonard Thurneysser
attained world-wide celebrity as an astrologer
and nativity-caster. He was a physician, printer,
bookseller, and horoscopist all in one. He professed
that, by the aid of astrology, he could not
only predict future events, but likewise prolong
life. He published yearly an astrological calendar,
describing the nature of the forthcoming year
and its chief events. His calendar and other
quackeries enabled him to amass the sum of
one thousand florins. He declared that every
man lay under the influence of a certain star,
by which his destiny was ruled. On ascertaining
from what planet a person’s misfortunes or
sickness proceeded, he advised his patient to
remove his residence within the control of a more
propitious luminary. In short, to escape from
the influence of a malignant to a more friendly
satellite was the basis of his theory.</p>

<p>Marsilius Ficinus, in his <i>Treatise on the Prolongation
of Life</i>, recommended all prudent persons
to consult an astrologer every seven years, thereby
to avoid any danger which might threaten them.
During the year 1470, an individual named
Pansa dedicated to the Council of Leipsic a book
entitled <i>The Prolongation of Life</i>, in which he
most strongly urges all persons desirous of longevity
to be on their guard every seven years,
because Saturn, a hostile planet, ruled at these
periods. According to the teachings of astrology,
metals were believed to be in intimate connection
with the planets. Thus no doubt it was that
amulets and talismans originated, as reputed
agents for prolonging life. The disciples of this
creed had amulets and talismans cast of the proper
metal, and under the influence of certain constellations,
in order to protect themselves from the
evil influence of adverse planets. These absurd
conceits were at a later period revived by
Cagliostro, of whom we shall have more to say
presently. It would indeed appear that the more
mysterious and ridiculous the conceptions of
fanatics and impostors were, the greater was their
success.</p>

<p>The example of the renowned Cornaro affords a
brilliant instance of the superiority of an abstemious
life to the foolish doctrines put forth at that
period. Up to forty years of age he was excessively
intemperate both in eating and drinking,
so that his health suffered considerably. He then
resolved to submit himself to a strictly temperate
regimen, and for the remaining sixty years of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">{412}</span>
life, which almost reached one hundred years, he
continued the observance of his rules, with the
result given. Although life might be prolonged
by exercising greater moderation in eating and
drinking than is generally adopted, yet, nevertheless,
few persons could safely follow so strict a
dietary.</p>

<p>Shortly after the death of Louis XIII. of France,
who was bled forty-seven times during the last
ten months of existence, a contrary method came
into fashion. Transfusion was for a time relied
upon as a means for invigorating and prolonging
life. The operation was performed by aid of a
small pipe conveying blood from the artery of
one person to another. In Paris, Drs Dennis
and Riva were enabled to cure a young man who
had previously been treated in vain for lethargy.
Further experiments not being so satisfactory,
this device as a prolonger of life became discarded.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon held somewhat unique ideas
regarding the possible prolongation of existence.
He regarded life as a flame continually being consumed
by the surrounding atmosphere, and he
thence concluded that by retarding vital waste
and renewing the bodily powers from time to
time, life might be lengthened. With the object
of preventing undue external vital waste, he
advised cold bathing, followed by friction. Tranquillity
of mind, cooling food, with the use of
opiates, he advocated as the most suitable measures
for lessening internal consumption. Furthermore,
he proposed to renovate life periodically, first by
a spare diet combined with cathartics; subsequently,
through choice of a refreshing and succulent
diet. With some degree of modification,
there seems to be much wisdom in his views,
excepting as regards the use of opiates, which are
decidedly of a prejudicial nature.</p>

<p>Numerous charlatans have appeared, and still
appear at intervals, loud in their asseverations of
having discovered the veritable elixir of life—gold,
tinctures, and many other nostrums with
which they mendaciously promise to prolong
life. The most notorious of these empirics
was the Count de St Germain, who with barefaced
effrontery protested that he had already
existed for centuries by aid of his ‘Tea of
Long Life,’ which he declared would rejuvenate
mankind. On close examination, his miraculous
philter was ascertained to consist of a
simple infusion of sandal-wood, fennel, and senna
leaves.</p>

<p>A great stir was created in 1785 by the occult
pretensions of a fanatical physician in France
named Mesmer. He vaunted the possession of
extraordinary magnetic power, which enabled him
forthwith, by its agency, to remove every disease
and prolong life. At the king’s desire, a commission
was instituted to report upon this phenomenon,
in which Dr Franklin took a leading part.
The only practical result of this inquiry was the
discovery of animal electricity. At one time,
Mesmer refused three hundred and forty thousand
livres for his secret. After Dr Franklin’s investigations,
Mesmer lapsed into obscurity.</p>

<p>Last, but not least in the foremost rank of
impostors was Joseph Balsamo, alias Count de
Cagliostro. This charlatan appeared just before
the first French Revolution. During his remarkable
career, Cagliostro made more than one fortune,
which he subsequently lost, and died in
prison in 1795. The distinguished Cardinal de
Rohan was one of his chief dupes. Like St
Germain, Balsamo boasted that he had discovered
the elixir of life, and throughout Europe, found
persons of all degrees eager to possess his panacea.
This elixir was a very powerful stomachic, possessed
of great stimulating properties, tending to
augment vital sensations. It is a fixed law of
nature that everything which increases the vital
forces tends to abridge their duration. Concentrated
and potent stimulants, which are usually
the active principle of most elixirs, although for
the time increasing physical strength, are in truth
very prejudicial to longevity.</p>

<p>We will now pass on to examine other theories
more worthy of attention, before we proceed to
establish what at present appears to be the most
certain means for promoting longevity. The plan
of ‘hardening’—based upon a false supposition
that by toughening the physical organs they
would wear longer—obtained at one time numerous
followers. When we reflect that the main
principle of life depends upon the pliability of
every organ, combined with free circulation, it
naturally follows that rigidity must be unfriendly
to longevity. Perpetual cold baths, exposure to
keen air, and exhausting exercise, were advocated
by the ‘hardening school.’ Like most enthusiasts,
they carried their ideas to excess, a limited use of
which would have been beneficial. Later on, a
theory well suited to the idle and luxurious gained
many adherents, namely, to retard bodily waste
by a trance-like sleep. One enthusiast, Maupertuis,
went so far as to propound the possibility
of completely suspending vital activity. Even
Dr Franklin, having observed the restoration of
apparently dead flies by exposure to warmth, was
struck with the feasibility of promoting long life
by the agency of immobility. The misconception
of this theory, from a physiological point of view,
is at once self-evident, as want of exercise is
simply poisonous to health. Upon a constant
metamorphosis of the tissues, physical well-being
must depend to a great extent. A destructive
plethora would most certainly be induced by
attempting ‘vital suspension.’</p>

<p>That celebrated sect of mystical philosophers,
the Rosicrucians—famous for their profound
acquaintance with natural phenomena, and the
higher branches of physical, chemical, and
medical science—considered that human existence
might be protracted far beyond its supposed
limits. They professed to retard old age by
means of certain medicaments, whose action upon
the system should curb the progress of natural
decay. The means by which they professed to
check senile decrepitude, were, like other mysteries
of their fraternity, never revealed. The celebrated
English Rosicrucian Dr Fludd, whose
writings became famous, is said to have lived a
century.</p>

<p>The principal disadvantage of the various plans
which have been set forth for promoting longevity
appears to be that they are all deficient in this
important respect—that they only regard <i>one
object, and neglect the rest</i>. However beneficial
any theory may prove, it must be materially
inadequate in fulfilling its purpose, should numerous
other matters of the greatest importance
bearing upon the human economy be ignored.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">{413}</span>
Hufeland, in his luminous work <i>The Art of Prolonging
Life</i>, is of opinion that the real art of
longevity consists in cultivating those agents
which protract existence, and by avoiding all
circumstances tending to shorten its duration.
This is undoubtedly the most reasonable method
for obtaining the end in view. Moderation in all
things (avoiding as far as possible every morbific
condition), and open air exercise, are far
more reliable means of prolonging life than any
of the elixirs and panaceas ever advocated.
Finally, health and longevity can only be attained
by an intimate acquaintance with and obedience
to those natural laws which govern our physical
economy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_GENTLEMAN_OF_THE_ROAD">A GENTLEMAN OF THE ROAD.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago, or, as children’s stories say,
‘once upon a time,’ when Bath was in all its
glory, and Beau Nash reigned as its king, two
ladies were journeying towards that fashionable
town in a postchaise. Why two middle-aged
ladies should in those unsafe times have undertaken
a journey without any male escort, I
cannot say; the result proved that they were
very ill advised in doing so. It was broad daylight,
and not very far from Bath, when the
postboy suddenly pulled up the horses, and the
chaise-door was thrown open from without with
the usual stern command: ‘Your money, or your
life!’</p>

<p>I need hardly say anything as to the state of
terror into which the ladies immediately fell;
no doubt they screamed, in spite of the uselessness
of such a proceeding; but it is not upon
record that they fainted. On the contrary, the
one nearest to the door submissively handed her
watch, purse, trinkets, &amp;c., to the masked highwayman;
and the other, a Mrs C., was hastily
preparing to get rid of her valuables in the same
way, when the robber turned to remount his
horse, as though he had overlooked the second
occupant of the carriage.</p>

<p>Such an unbusiness-like proceeding certainly
did not bespeak him an accomplished ‘gentleman
of the road;’ for in those days the search for
valuables was usually conducted in a thorough
and energetic manner, often accompanied with
more or less violence, especially if the searcher
had reason to suspect that the notes were ‘sham
Abrams,’ or the watches from the manufactory
of Mr Pinchbeck.</p>

<p>By the way, do any of the present generation
know the term of ‘Pinchbeck’ for sham-gold?
and if any of them do, are they aware how the
term arose? To meet violence with craft, the
travellers of those days provided themselves very
frequently with false bank-notes and imitation
gold watches, to be given up as booty, while the
genuine articles were carefully hidden; and a
Mr Pinchbeck started a manufactory of these
watches. But the ‘gentlemen of the road’ soon
got up to this trick, and to prevent such mistakes,
they insisted on their victims taking solemn oaths
as to the notes being those genuinely signed by
‘Abraham Newland,’ the cashier of the Bank of
England; and also that the watches had not
been supplied by Mr Pinchbeck.</p>

<p>What passed through Mrs C.’s mind as the
highwayman turned away with only half his
spoil, it is impossible to say. Perhaps it occurred
to her that he might find out his mistake, come
back, and take vengeance on them for their
involuntary deception. Or perhaps she never
thought at all, but acted on a terror-struck
impulse. I do not suppose that she herself ever
knew <i>why</i> she acted as she did, but she actually
called to the highwayman to come back!</p>

<p>‘Stop, stop!’ she cried; ‘you have not got my
watch and purse!’</p>

<p>The ‘gentleman of the road’ came back again
to the chaise-door, and held out his hand for the
watch and purse which Mrs C. seemed so anxious
to get rid of. But that watch and purse had
unknowingly been the bait of something very
like a trap; at anyrate, the turning back was a
fatal move, for as the robber turned quickly to
relieve Mrs C. of her valuables, the quick movement
of his head, or a passing puff of wind, blew
aside his crape-mask for a moment, and Mrs C.
saw his face distinctly.</p>

<p>When the ladies arrived at Bath, they were
condoled with by their friends on their fright
and their loss; and no doubt Mrs C. had to stand
a good deal of joking about her kindly calling
the highwayman back to take her own watch and
purse. But such occurrences were too common
for the condolences to be deep or long continued,
or to cause interference on the part of any one
whose duty it might have been to attend to the
peace and safety of the public; and the ‘nine
days’ wonder’—if it continued so long—certainly
did not last any longer.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think, however, that Mrs C.
kept her own counsel as to one result of that
calling back, and told no one of her having seen
the robber’s face unmasked.</p>

<p>Some weeks had passed away, when one
evening Mrs C. was at the Assembly Rooms,
together with all ‘the rank and fashion’ of Bath.
She was talking to a friend, a gentleman named
Mr M., and at the same time surveying the ladies
and gentlemen who frequented the Assembly,
when she suddenly exclaimed: ‘There’s the man
who robbed me!’</p>

<p>‘Where?’ asked Mr M., in great astonishment.</p>

<p>Mrs C. pointed to a fashionably dressed young
man who was talking to some of the company.</p>

<p>‘My dear Mrs C.,’ said Mr M., ‘pray, be more
careful. You really must not bring such an
accusation as this against that gentleman. Why,
he is young H., son of Mr H. of ——, a very
wealthy and well-known man; and young H. is
in all the best company. I know him well as a
friend.’ This was said in a joking manner, as
Mr M. thought that Mrs C. was making an absurd
mistake, deceived perhaps by some slight, or even
fancied, resemblance.</p>

<p>But Mrs C. said seriously: ‘I do not care who
he is, or what his father is, or even as to his
being a friend of yours. That is the man who
robbed me! I am quite certain about him, for
when he turned back to take my purse and watch,
his crape-mask blew aside, and I distinctly saw
his face. I remember it perfectly.’</p>

<p>Mr M. again tried to persuade her that she
was mistaken; but to no purpose. Still trying
to make a joke of her supposed extraordinary
delusion, he said to Mrs C.: ‘I will bring him
here, and introduce him to you, and then see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">{414}</span>
if you will still assert he is a highwayman!’
Before she could decline the introduction, Mr M.
crossed the room to where the young man was
standing, and said with a smile: ‘Here’s a joke,
H. That lady over there declares you are a
highwayman, and that you are the man who
robbed her a few weeks since! Come and be
introduced to her.’</p>

<p>But young H. did not take the joke as his
friend meant it; on the contrary, he answered in
rather an ill-tempered manner: ‘I do not want
to be introduced to the old fool!’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Mr M., ‘you need not have taken
it in that way, and lost your temper about such
a trifle. Of course I was only in fun. I thought
you would have enjoyed the joke, and tried to
persuade her that you were an honest man, and
not a gentleman of the road. Pray, do not be
offended.’ So saying, Mr M. returned to Mrs C.,
and reported that the young gentleman had taken
the joke in ill part, and refused to be introduced
to her.</p>

<p>Once more Mrs C. declared it was neither a joke
nor a mistake, but that in serious fact young H.
was the highwayman whom she had called back
to take her watch and purse. The subject was
then allowed to drop; and after a little conversation
on other matters, Mr M. took his leave of
Mrs C., with the intention of smoothing the matter
over with his friend H., as he did not want their
friendship to be interrupted, and he had clearly
seen that Mr H. was much annoyed. With this
friendly intention he looked about in the Assembly
Rooms for young Mr H., but without success.
He then inquired of some mutual friends, and was
told that young Mr H. had left the Rooms almost
directly after he, Mr M., had last spoken to him,
and had seemed much annoyed and disturbed.</p>

<p>This account made Mr M. all the more anxious
to find his friend and put the matter right with
him. Leaving the Rooms, Mr M. looked in at
their club, and at two or three other places where
he thought it likely he might find Mr H. But
his search was unsuccessful; and he had to go
home without seeing his friend, comforting himself
with the thought that he would next day
call on Mr H. at his father’s house, where he
lived.</p>

<p>But next day young H. was not at his father’s;
nor indeed did he ever again appear in Bath.
When he left the Assembly Rooms, he returned
home, changed his dress, and at once left Bath,
and—it was supposed—left England also at the
earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Of the grief and agony of his father and of his
family, I will not speak; it can easily be imagined
what distress and shame they suffered.</p>

<p>Mr H., the father, was a wealthy man, of good
position and family; but the young man, an only
son, brought up to no profession, but only to
inherit his father’s riches, had fallen, probably
from sheer want of employment, into bad company,
had played for very high stakes—lost—played
again—exhausted his father’s patience in
paying his debts, and at last had ‘taken to the
road’ to replenish his purse—a not very uncommon
proceeding in those days—while at the
same time keeping his place in society.</p>

<p>From his unbusiness-like haste and want of
looking after the whole of the booty, in the
case of Mrs C. and her friend, it is to be presumed
that he had only lately adopted the practice of—as
it was politely called—‘collecting his rents
on the road,’ even if it was not his first attempt.
How long, however, he might have continued the
‘collection,’ but for the accident of the mask
having been blown aside, is another question.</p>

<p>If this were fiction, I might enlarge on young
H.’s future career in another land. I might, on
the one hand, make him go from bad to worse,
and end his career by murder and a murderer’s
death. Or, on the other hand, I might depict
him as leading a new life in a new country, and
eventually returning to England, to the joy and
comfort of his family, and worthily inheriting
his father’s wealth and position. I might even
describe his penitent introduction to Mrs C., and
his deep gratitude to her for checking him in
his downward career; and still further might
end the romance by his falling in love with,
and marrying Mrs C.’s daughter. But romance
is denied to me, for the story is not fiction,
but fact in all its details. Mrs C. was an
ancestress of the writer’s, and the story has been
handed down in the family.</p>

<p>Being, therefore, obliged to keep to facts, I am
compelled to admit that I know nothing as to
young H.’s after-life; so I must close my true
history by supposing that he was never again
heard of in his native country for good or evil,
after his detection by Mrs C. as ‘a gentleman of
the road.’</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no lack of literature about Cornwall.
Hardly any other county in England finds so
many to write about it. It is a favourite
with novelists as a place in which to give
their imaginary characters ‘a local habitation
and a name;’ and Tre, Pol, and Pen abound
in their pages. Every year there is a crop of
articles about it in the newspapers and magazines
for the benefit of those who choose it for the
scene of their autumn rambles, or who wish
to renew their recollection of its rocky headlands,
washed by the deep-blue Atlantic waves,
its sheltered coves, its glorious sunsets, and its
wealth of ferns and rare birds and flowers. In
nine cases out of ten, it is of the Land’s End and
its neighbourhood that people thus write; indeed,
in the minds of many at a distance, the Land’s
End <i>is</i> Cornwall, much as the Fens are popularly
supposed to be Lincolnshire. But there is much
that is interesting about the county and its people
which only those who live in Cornwall are likely
to observe. It is not as other counties, and the
Cornish are not as other folk who live ‘up the
country’—the local name for all beyond the Tamar.
They have peculiarities of custom and of speech,
not to be accounted for merely by the fact that
they are far away from the great centres of
national life, and are, as it were, living in the
day before yesterday. They are of a distinct
race, the kindred of the Welsh, the Irish, and
the Bretons, but a race whose language has
perished, save in the names of places and people;
and the tongue they speak is not the English of
to-day, but, with a mixture of Celtic idiom, the
English of two centuries ago, the English of our
translation of the Bible. Cornwall is emphatically
an ancient county, and there is an unmistakably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">{415}</span>
old-world flavour about everything that belongs
to it.</p>

<p>One thing which particularly strikes any one
who converses much with the labouring classes
is, that they speak much more grammatically
than their compeers usually do. There are the
peculiar idioms which we have just mentioned; but
apart from these, the language is rather that of
educated people than what one usually hears in
other counties. This arises from the fact that
English was scarcely introduced into Cornwall
until the Elizabethan age, and that when it was
introduced it was by the upper classes. The rest,
who used Cornish for their intercourse with each
other, learned English as a foreign tongue, and
learned the refined form of it. That form it still
retains; and hence, quaint and odd as it is when
used in the Cornish way, from the lips of these
western folk it is never vulgar. We are not well
enough read in the mysteries of the ancient
tongue to know the reason for the singular use
of the personal pronouns, but certain it is that
they seem to have a rooted antipathy to the
objective case. ‘Tell it to she,’ ‘Bring he to I,’
and ‘This is for we,’ are the universal forms.
Then the preposition ‘to’ is always used instead
of ‘at,’ as, ‘I live to Bodmin.’ In Cornwall, too,
people are never surprised, but ‘frightened’ or
‘hurried;’ never in a bad temper, but in a
‘poor’ one; and the very eggs and milk, if kept
too long, go ‘poor.’ When they live beyond
their means, they ‘go scat;’ and if they are not
too particular as to honourable dealing, they
‘furneague.’</p>

<p>But in spite of these peculiarities, one hears the
ring of good old English speech, such as nowadays
we may look for vainly elsewhere, save in the
pages of the Bible. Girls are spoken of as the
maids or the maidens, and when they leave the
house, they ‘go forth.’ ‘Come forth, my son,’ is
an invitation one often hears, occasionally even
when ‘my son’ turns out to be a horse or a dog.
And if we wish to know the name of any little
boy whom we may meet, the best chance of
getting an intelligible answer is to put the
question in the form of, ‘How are you called,
my son?’</p>

<p>In things that meet the eye, too, we seem to
have come into an older world in Cornwall.
There are the old-fashioned earthen or ‘clomb’
pitchers, of exactly the pattern we see in the
pictures of old Bibles in the hands of Rebekah or
Zipporah; though we cannot say we ever saw one
balanced upon the top of a woman’s head. Till
very lately, oxen were still used to draw the
plough; and to this day, in the country districts,
kitchen stoves, and indeed coal-fires of any sort,
are hardly known. The fuel is commonly dried
furze, which is burned either in an earthen oven
or on a wide open hearth. It is thrown on piece
by piece with a pitchfork, till the iron plate on
which the baking is to be done is considered hot
enough; then the plate is swept clean, and the
cakes—biscuits, as they are termed—or pasties
having been ranged in order upon it, an iron
vessel shaped somewhat like a flower-pot is turned
over them, the furze is again piled on, and a
large heap of glowing embers raked over all.
No further attention is paid to the cooking; but
when the embers are cold, the things are done.
And those pasties, what wonderful productions
they are to the uninitiated; there appears to be
scarcely any article of food that does not find its
way into them. Parsley pasties, turnip pasties
(very good these are, too), ‘licky,’ that is, <i>leek</i>
pasties, pasties of conger-eel, of potatoes and
bacon, of all kinds of meat and of all kinds of
fruit, the variety is endless.</p>

<p>In the old days, the Cornish were great
smugglers. Indeed, the natural features of the
coast are such, that they would have been almost
more than human if they were not. Even when
it did not pay very well, the love of adventure
enlisted the whole population in its favour. The
farmers who did not themselves help to run a
cargo on a moonless night, would, when the
riders—the coastguard—were out of the way,
lend their horses to those who did, so that
long before daylight the kegs were all carried
off far inland, or stowed away in the hiding-holes
which nearly every house possessed. A
darker page of Cornish history is that of the
days of wrecking. Terrible sights have some of
those pitiless beaches witnessed, when the doomed
vessel was lured on by false lights to be the prey
of men more pitiless still. At St Eval, between
Padstow and Newquay, a lame horse used to be
led on stormy nights along the cliffs with a lantern
fixed on its head; and many a craft, supposing
it to be the light of a ship riding at anchor, was
then steered by her luckless crew straight into
the very jaws of death. Wrecks were looked
upon as a legitimate harvest of the sea, even as
things to be prayed for, like a shoal of pilchards
or a lode of tin. The remains of that feeling
are not extinct even yet. A few years ago, a
vessel laden with Manchester goods was wrecked
on the north coast. Her name was the <i>Good
Samaritan</i>. Of course such of her cargo as
was saved was supposed to be handed over to
the coastguard, according to law; but a good
deal of flotsam and jetsam was quietly appropriated
notwithstanding, the fortunate finders
never dreaming that there could be anything
morally wrong in such acquisitions, though they
might not be strictly legal. Some months afterwards,
a lady of the neighbourhood was visiting
the cottagers and asking them how they had got
through the hard winter that was just over; and
she was told by one of the simple folk that times
had been bad indeed, that work had been slack
and wages low, and that it had been a severe
struggle to keep a home together. ‘And indeed
I don’t know what we should have done, if the
Lord hadn’t sent us the <i>Good Samaritan</i>!’</p>

<p>It is reported of a worthy old parson on the
west coast at the end of the last century, when
wrecks were considered as godsends, and it was an
article of faith that the owners of a ship lost all
title to their property the moment her keel touched
ground, that in the long extempore prayer which,
in defiance of the rubrics, was then generally
indulged in before the sermon, he was accustomed,
as the winter drew on, to introduce a reference
to this grim ocean harvest, in some such style as
this: ‘Lord, we do not pray for wrecks; but since
there <i>must</i> be some, grant, we beseech Thee, that
they may be on our beach.’ Perhaps this was the
divine who was in the middle of his sermon when
the news reached the church that a vessel had just
struck and was going to pieces in the bay, and
who instantly concluded with the benediction, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">{416}</span>
left his surplice in the pulpit, so that he and his
congregation might start fair upon the shore. Yet
eager as was the rivalry for what could be snatched
from the sea, there was no pilfering from any
man’s heap. To this day, you have but to put a
stone upon anything you find upon the beach, in
token that it has been ‘saved,’ and you may leave
it in perfect safety, for no Cornishman will take
it then. If, on your return, you find it gone, you
may be sure that some less scrupulous ‘up-country
people’ have been by that way.</p>

<p>As to the ferns, every botanist knows the green
treasures of this western land. Indeed, we wish he
did not know quite so well; for though men of
science may be trusted to pursue their researches
without wanton destruction of the beauties of
nature, it is too often far otherwise with the
tourist. It is not only ’Arry who is to blame in
this matter; those from whom one might expect
more consideration for the feelings and the
rights of others are not seldom the greatest
sinners of all. Only last summer, a young man
actually stripped two large hamperfuls of the
beautiful sea-fern (<i>Asplenium marinum</i>) from
the roof of a cave, utterly ruining its beauty
for several years to come. There were plenty
of specimens to be had elsewhere upon the
cliffs for the climbing; but he must needs get
a ladder and take fifty times as many as
he could possibly want, just where it most
grieved the inhabitants of the neighbourhood
to lose them. But we fear our righteous indignation
at the iniquities of the tourist will run
away with us—how he ruthlessly exterminates
rare ferns; how he comes into churches where
service is going on, and walks about and stares
around him; how he strews scenes of natural
loveliness with his sandwich papers and his
broken bottles; how he thinks to add interest
to the rocks and cliffs by inscribing his name
and the date of his visit upon their face. It is
his mission, we suppose, to ‘vulgarise creation.’
But Cornwall will take a great deal of spoiling
yet, and so will its people and its language,
menaced as this last is by the penny paper and
the Board School. And those who like a peep
into a world which, in spite of railways and
telegraphs and newspapers and nineteenth-century
ideas, is still an old world, and full of old and
quaint and beautiful things, will find enough in
Cornwall to occupy them, as a Cornishman would
say, for a ‘brave little bit of time.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NET_OF_MARRIAGE">THE NET OF MARRIAGE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Rev. Harry Jones, writing in the <i>Sunday
at Home</i>, says: ‘Some people, especially if they
marry young and on the impulse of some taking
fancy, without a due consideration of the very
grave nature of the state they are entering, discover
afterwards that his or her mate does not
come up to the expectations which had been
formed. The light and laughing love of the
marriage and the early periods of married life
are succeeded by a sense of disappointment.
Then comes domestic indifference, perhaps recrimination.
Both man and wife are deceived,
and undeceived. Unintentionally perhaps, but
really. Both feel, as it were, entangled. They
have married in haste, and repent too often, not
at leisure, but with mutual bitterness and ill-concealed
unconcern for one another. Each generally
thinks the other most to blame. And I do
not believe that I am overstepping the limits of
appropriate language when I say that the idea
of being caught in a net represents their secret
convictions. Here is a disastrous state of affairs.
In this country, such a net cannot be easily
broken. The pair have married for worse, in a
more serious sense than these words are intended
to bear in the marriage vows. What is to be
done? I should very imperfectly express my
advice if I simply said, “Make the best of it.”
For though this is a rude rendering of the advice
needed, much might be said to show how this
can be done after a Christian way.... It is a
great Christian rule that, to be loved, we must
show kindness and consideration, and not expect
to receive what we do not grant ourselves.
“Give,” says Christ, “and it shall be given unto
you. Judge not, and you shall not be judged.
Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned.”
And if this applies anywhere, it applies most in
the case of those who are in the close relationship
of husband and wife. Clouds sometimes
come over the married life because too much
consideration is expected. Show it, I would say,
rather than demand it, if it has seemed to come
short. Do not think to mend matters by a half-grudging
endurance, but ask God to give His
sacred help to the keeping of the rule “bear and
forbear.” So may a hasty marriage, the beauty
of which has been spoilt by some misunderstandings,
ripen into the true affection which should
mark this holy estate, and the cloud of disappointment
give place to a love which rests upon
no passing fancy, but upon an honest Christian
observance between man and wife of the vow
betwixt them made. So may the miserable afterthought
of having been entangled in a relationship
be blotted out, and succeeded, as years go
on, by a love cemented with the desire to do
right before God, in whose presence, and with
prayer for whose blessing, the relationship was
begun.’</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
